			<h2 class="desc_title">Aspiration</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">For this project I decided to continue on with a previous group project that I was part of, which was about loneliness and how we could somehow lessen it in the daily life of a person. We went on to do a “design sprint” that stretched out over 5 “days” each with a different theme of the design process. We started of mapping and researching to then move on to the sketching phase, to the “deciding” phase, to prototype and lastly to test. To summarize we created an event app of sorts where the user could create events which would in turn lessen the overall loneliness of people. The overall feedback that we got were mostly positive.
I decided to take the theme of loneliness and completely revamp the concept since I personally wanted to approach the problem in an entirely different way, so I took this opportunity to do that. In this round I wanted to, as cheesy as it sounds, to awake a feeling of hope with the concept I came up with. Something I feel like I ultimately failed to do.</p>

			<h2 class="desc_title">Audience</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">The target audience for this project that were decided last time were initially started with lonely people who might have a difficult time with reaching out, we then changed the target audience to lonely people between 18-30 years old.
For this round I decided to use the same target audience but get more involved with understanding the problem. The question now is to create something maybe not from scratch but from the concept that we had in the last course that would somehow grab the target audience into using the product that I want to create.
				</p>
			<h2 class="desc_title">Inspired</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
				There are many ways to create something to combat loneliness and somehow, I would need to come up with one. Fortunately, I already had an idea in mind, an idea that was ruthlessly shot down (jokes) when I pitched it to my group in the last course. The idea was to create an app that would have no chat, the users would be able to do 1 task a day together with people from around the world and you would then after the task be able to send out a “message bottle” to a random person in the world in an attempt to hopefully make people feel less lonely knowing there are people out there cheering them on.
This was an idea inspired to me by a video game called "Nier: Automata". A game that left a huge impression on me when I completed it.
				</p>
			<h2 class="desc_title">The prototype</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">The way the prototype looks is also heavily inspired by the game "Nier: Automata", as I thought the color palette of the game would fit the theme that was loneliness. Though looking back at it now I might have captured the theme a little bit too well, as the prototype is quite dark and gloomy looking which was by design, however I feel like I failed to capture the most important feeling that was supposed to be present in the prototype, the feeling of hope and unity. Were I to work further with the prototype I am sure that I would eventually be able to reach my goal of creating an app that would make someone feel a little bit better.	</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Unluckily the prototype has for some unknown reason ceased to work in Figma.
				If it did work it would look a little something like this:</p>
